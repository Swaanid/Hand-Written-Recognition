In this handwritten digit recognition project using the MNIST dataset, we successfully implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, along with batch normalization and dropout, to classify digits from 0 to 9. We preprocessed the data by normalizing pixel values and splitting it into training and validation sets. The model achieved promising results, demonstrating its ability to accurately classify digits on the validation set. Additionally, we visualized actual labels against predicted labels for a subset of the test data, providing insights into the model's performance. Despite encountering and resolving challenges such as data reshaping and evaluation mismatches, the project showcases the successful development and evaluation of a neural network for handwritten digit recognition.

This project serves as an illustrative example of building a practical image classification model using a popular dataset. The use of a CNN architecture, data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics provides valuable hands-on experience for understanding and implementing deep learning solutions. Further enhancements could involve fine-tuning hyperparameters, exploring alternative architectures, or deploying the model for real-world applications. The successful completion of this project lays the foundation for continued exploration and learning in the field of computer vision and neural networks.
